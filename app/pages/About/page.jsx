      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Our founder, Phillip Bailey, has always been interested in wellness. After years of studying and practicing different approaches to health and happiness, she realized that many people didn't have access to the resources she had. That's when she decided to create a platform where anyone could learn about wellness and live their best life.
